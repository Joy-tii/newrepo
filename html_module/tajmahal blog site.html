    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the Seven Wonders of the World, stands as a testament to India's rich history, architectural genius, and the eternal power of love. Located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, this iconic monument attracts millions of visitors from around the globe each year. Built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, the Taj Mahal is more than just a mausoleum—it's a story carved in white marble.

    <h2>The History Behind the Taj Mahal</h2>
    <p>
        The story of the Taj Mahal begins with a love that transcended time. Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor, was deeply devoted to Mumtaz Mahal. Tragically, Mumtaz passed away in 1631 while giving birth to their 14th child. Devastated by her death, Shah Jahan vowed to create a monument that would honor her memory forever.

Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and took over 20 years to complete. Over 20,000 artisans, craftsmen, and laborers from across the Mughal empire contributed to its construction. The finest materials, including white marble from Makrana in Rajasthan and precious stones from all over Asia, were used to create this architectural masterpiece.
