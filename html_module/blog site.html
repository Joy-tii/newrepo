    <img src="./../aseet/gettyimages-1198855433-612x612.jpg" width="100%" height="500">
    <h3 style="color: brown;">Introduction</h3>
    <p>Changing fields can be daunting, especially when moving from hardware-focused Electrical Engineering to software-driven Computer Science. However, this journey has been both rewarding and transformative for me. Here’s how I made the switch and why it’s been one of the best decisions of my life.</p>
<h3 style="color: brown;">My Background in Electrical Engineering</h3>
<p>During my diploma in Electrical Engineering, I worked on projects like an Automatic Solar Tracker and a Health Monitoring System using Arduino. These experiences gave me a foundation in problem-solving, logic, and circuit design, which surprisingly aligned well with programming.</p>
<h3 style="color: brown;">Why the Shift?</h3>
<p>While I loved working with hardware, I was drawn to the limitless possibilities of software. The world of coding felt dynamic and exciting, and I wanted to explore how technology could solve real-world problems.</p>
<h3 style="color: brown;">Adapting to Computer Science</h3>
<p>The transition wasn’t easy. I had to learn new programming languages like C++, Python, and Kotlin from scratch. Projects in my B.Tech, like working on a mobile app’s front-end and designing interfaces in Figma, helped me build confidence.</p>
<h3 style="color: brown;">Lessons Learned</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b style="color: rgb(20, 2, 63);">Never Stop Learning:</b> Every skill from my Electrical background added value to my current studies.</li>
    <li><b style="color: rgb(20, 2, 63);">Be Patient: </b> Switching fields requires time, effort, and persistence.</li>
    <li><b style="color: rgb(20, 2, 63);">Connect the Dots: My hardware skills often complement my software work, making me a more versatile engineer.</b> My hardware skills often complement my software work, making me a more versatile engineer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: brown;">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Transitioning from Electrical Engineering to Computer Science has been a journey of growth and discovery. It’s proof that with curiosity and hard work, you can navigate any career path.</p>
